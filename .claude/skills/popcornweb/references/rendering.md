# Rendering Behaviors

How Popcorn Web turns templates into responses beyond the basic `pw.WriteHTML` call: discovered routing (the page tree), async rendering, partial updates, live rendering, and form handling. Registered routing means handlers you register in Go; discovered routing means routes generated from a page tree directory. The two share one mux (`pw.ServeMux` is a type alias), and a project can carry either or both. All generated `_pw_gen.go` files are build outputs — never edit them; rerun `pw generate`.

Server actions, component scripts, and signals are in [interactivity.md](interactivity.md); `@cache` and the response cache policy are in [caching.md](caching.md).

## Discovered routing: a directory is a route

A directory holding `page.pw.html` under the tree root (default `pages/`, set by `generate.pages` in `popcornweb.toml`) is a `GET` route. Nothing registers it by hand — `pw generate` walks the tree and writes the registrations.

```
pages/
├── page.pw.html                → GET /{$}        (root; not bare "/" which would match everything)
├── layout.pw.html
└── users/id_/page.pw.html      → GET /users/{id}
```

Directory naming: a route directory is also a Go package, so dynamic segments are spelled with trailing underscores — `id_/` is `{id}`, `rest__/` is a catch-all `{rest...}` (binds as a string). `[id]`, `{id}`, `:id`, `(group)` etc. are illegal Go import path elements and are rejected by discovery. Directories starting with `_` or `.`, and `testdata`, are ignored.

Wire both routers onto one mux; order does not matter, but registering the same method+path twice panics at startup:

```go
mux := handlers.Handlers()  // registered: your API
pages.Register(mux)         // discovered: the website
```

Scope of the shape: a page is a `GET` that renders a template; its actions are `POST` endpoints. File downloads, webhooks, `PUT`s, and anything that must appear in OpenAPI are registered routes (discovered routes generate no OpenAPI, by design).

### Two rungs

What sits beside `page.pw.html` decides how much Go runs, and the question is
only whether `page.go` exists:

| Files | Rung | What you get |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `page.pw.html` only | template | the whole handler is generated; the page's own `external` calls fetch its data |
| `+ page.go` with `func Load(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request)` | handler | only the registration is generated; the response is yours |

A `Load` that is not the handler signature fails generation naming what it is and
what it must be. The entry point is named `Load` (not `Page`) because the
compiled template already emits `func Page(params PageParams) …` into the same
package.

There used to be a third rung between these, where `page.go` declared
`func Load(id string) (User, error)` and the generated handler called it. It was
retired in tinybind v0.5.13 — a project still holding one meets a build failure
naming the replacement, and nothing rewrites it for you.

**A page that loads data does not need a rung of its own.** It declares its
loader as an `external` and binds it with `val`, so the call sits in the page's
own source:

```html
package id_

external LoadUser(id: string, page: int?): View

export component Page(id: string, page: int?): html {
{val view = LoadUser(id, page)}
<h1>{view.name}</h1>
<p>page {view.page}</p>
}
```

```go
func LoadUser(id string, page *int) (View, error) {
	number := 1
	if page != nil {
		number = *page
	}
	row, ok := store.User(id)
	if !ok {
		return View{}, pw.NotFound("no user " + id)
	}
	return View{Name: row.Name, Page: number}, nil
}
```

Losing the middle rung is a gain: its parameters were the *result* of the load,
and a page keyed on its result cannot be cached — computing the key would need
the load. Keyed on `id` above, the page is one `@cache` away from covering the
fetch and the render together (see [caching.md](caching.md)).

**Inputs are the component's parameters** — no struct, no binding tags. The
leading ones are the route's dynamic segments in route order; the rest are query
parameters keyed by parameter name, and a component whose leading parameters
disagree with its route fails generation naming both. A URL carries no objects,
so inputs are scalars; a trailing `?` binds a pointer, which is how an absent
`?page` stays distinguishable from `?page=0`.

**A loader chooses the response.** A `val` at the top of a page's body is
evaluated during chain assembly, before the document shell has written a byte, so
a trailing `error` still picks the status while the rest of the page streams. Any
problem constructor works — the generated handler passes what the render returned
to `pw.WriteProblem`, which reads the status off the error. A redirect is
returned rather than written, for the same reason:

```go
if _, ok := auth.User(ctx); !ok {
	return View{}, pw.SeeOther("/auth/login")
}
```

| | method may become GET | method preserved |
| --- | --- | --- |
| temporary | `pw.SeeOther` — 303 | `pw.TemporaryRedirect` — 307 |
| permanent | `pw.MovedPermanently` — 301 | `pw.PermanentRedirect` — 308 |

`pw.SeeOther` is the one a page reaches for. A returned redirect takes the same
path as a written one: the target is refused if a browser could only follow it by
running script, and an update request gets a navigate directive instead of a 303.
A loader reading the request context declares a leading `context.Context` —
routetree threads the request's, which is how the database handle and the
signed-in reader stay in reach. `{check Authorize(user)}` guards a page without
binding anything (see [templates.md](templates.md)).

Use the handler rung when the page must own its whole response: a download, a
conditional status, a stream. It composes its own chain, because a leaf cannot
call a composer above itself:

```go
func Load(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	route, err := DecodeRoute(r)
	if err != nil {
		pw.WriteProblem(w, r, err)
		return
	}
	_ = route
	wrappers := []pwpage.Wrapper{BindLayout(LayoutParams{})}
	if err := pwpage.Render(w, r, wrappers, Page(PageParams{})); err != nil {
		pw.WriteProblem(w, r, err)
	}
}
```

`BindLayout` is generated into the package holding the layout, so a deeper page
names its ancestors' — `pages.BindLayout(...)` for the root's, then each below
it, outermost first.

### Layouts

An ancestor `layout.pw.html` wraps every page below it, outermost first. It must declare `children: html` (that shape is what generates the wrapper binder), and it may only read dynamic segments at or above its own directory:

```html
package pages

export component Layout(children: html): html {
<div class="page"><slot required /></div>
}
```

The document shell is still outermost: `templates/document.pw.html` owns doctype/`<head>`/`<body>` and wraps the layout chain from outside. A `document.pw.html` placed inside the tree is not applied.

### Server actions

A template element names an exported Go handler and generation supplies the
address; a `<form server-action>` posts to the page's own path and answers `303`
with no JavaScript at all, while the runtime intercepts the submit when it is
present. The complete surface — the form and bare-element lowerings, the typed
`pw.ServerAction` shape a script calls, CSRF, and which to choose — is in
[interactivity.md](interactivity.md).

The generated registry exposes `Routes` and `Actions` tables for inspection.

### What is generated

```
pages/
├── layout.pw.html
├── layout_pw_gen.go     compiled layout component
├── page.pw.html
├── page_pw_gen.go       compiled page component
├── route_pw_gen.go      the route's parameters and decoder
├── routes_pw_gen.go     Register, Routes, and Actions
└── users/id_/
    ├── page.pw.html
    ├── page.go          optional Load, loaders, and server actions
    ├── page_pw_gen.go
    └── route_pw_gen.go
```

The registry lives in the tree root and nowhere else: a leaf imports the root for
its ancestor layouts, so the root importing the leaf would be a cycle. Every
generated import points down the tree.

Commands: `pw init mysite --router=discovered` (or `registered` / `both`), `pw add discovered` / `pw add registered` to install the other later, `pw new page` to add a route interactively (it asks for the URL, converts it to directories, and asks whether the page writes its own response). `pw dev` picks up new routes automatically. A tree root is never also listed under `generate.templates`.

**When not to use it:** anything that is not a GET page or its POST action — downloads, webhooks, non-GET APIs, endpoints that must appear in OpenAPI. Those are registered routes.

## Async rendering

An async page streams: the shell, the head, every settled value, and every `fallback` commit first; each slow section replaces its placeholder as its data settles — one HTTP response, no client-side data fetching.

Handler side — pass pending values instead of finished ones. No streaming API, no header, no flush; `pw.WriteHTML` streams only when the composed document holds an `await` boundary:

```go
pw.WriteHTML(w, r, Home(HomeParams{
	Profile:        Profile{Name: "Ada Lovelace", Joined: "2026-02-11"},
	Orders:         pw.Go(ctx, loadOrders),
	Recommendation: pw.Go(ctx, recommend),
}))
```

| Constructor | Use |
| --- | --- |
| `pw.Go(ctx, work)` | start the work now, in its own goroutine (`work` is `func(context.Context) (T, error)`) |
| `pw.Resolved(v)` | a value you already have, and tests |
| `pw.Failed(err)` | a failure you already know about |

A handle settles once and stays readable (a layout and a page may await the same handle; the work runs once). There is no channel constructor — receive from the channel inside the `pw.Go` closure. Starting early is the point: work overlaps everything rendered above it.

Template side — declare the parameter `async` and read it in an `await` block (syntax in references/templates.md):

```html
export component Home(profile: Profile, orders: async Order[]): html {
<h1>{profile.name}</h1>
{await list = orders}
  <ul>{for order in list}<li>{order.id} — {order.total}</li>{/for}</ul>
{fallback}
  <p class="pending">Loading orders…</p>
{/await}
}
```

Failure: with `recover`, the failure is contained to that section and the response stays 200 (the status left with the shell). Without `recover`, the framework replaces everything below the document shell with the page registered via `pw.RegisterHTMLErrorPage` — a `recover` subtree never sees a raw Go error (default `code: "internal"`; implement `PublicError() pw.AsyncError` for a safe projection). With `streaming = false` the same failure answers a real 500.

The runtime script: the document shell loads one small ES module that swaps each completion (`<template data-tb-boundary>` + `<tb-apply>`) into its `<tb-boundary>` placeholder. No inline script travels in the stream, so `script-src 'self'` suffices. The scaffolded shell references it through an external function because the URL carries a content-derived revision:

```html
external RuntimeScriptURL(): url

export component Document(children: html?): html {
<!doctype html>
<html><head>...<script type="module" src={RuntimeScriptURL()}></script></head>
<body><slot /></body></html>
}
```

```go
func RuntimeScriptURL() *url.URL { return &url.URL{Path: pw.RuntimeScriptURL()} }
```

`pw init` scaffolds both halves.

Clients without the runtime: crawlers and CLI clients (known bot names, plus any `User-Agent` not starting `Mozilla`, plus missing `User-Agent`) get the buffered, complete document — and truthful error statuses. A browser with scripting disabled is redirected once via a contributed `<noscript>` block to a buffered render of the same URL. `pw.IsBot(r)` may pick a cheaper query but must never change content or reach an access decision. Any streamable page carries `Vary: User-Agent`.

Configuration (`popcornweb.toml`, `[html]`): `streaming` (false forces buffered), `async_timeout` (default bound per boundary; expiry renders `recover` with `code:"timeout"`), `async_concurrency`, `bot_detection`, `bot_async_timeout` (default 5s), `bot_user_agents`, `scriptless_detection`.

**When not to use it:** a page whose data is already fast — a boundary adds a placeholder, a swap, and a connection held open until the slowest boundary settles (`async_timeout` is a resource bound). Fragments never stream. Write fallbacks as an enhancement over content that is already meaningful.

## Partial updates

The same URL answers a complete document to anything that asks for one, and to a page that already holds the layout it answers only the boundaries whose markup changed. Every layout and page of a rendered chain is already an update boundary (ordinary components deliberately are not). Handlers and templates are unchanged.

```toml
[html.update]
enabled = true
validator_key = "${HTML_UPDATE_VALIDATOR_KEY}"
```

Startup refuses `enabled = true` with no key (digests are keyed). Off by default: it adds a browser runtime to every document, a secret to deploy, and a rule that every re-render must be free of side effects.

Three paths, chosen by who holds the changed input:

- **Navigation** — input lives in the URL (sort, filter, page number). The runtime intercepts same-origin links and GET forms and the server sends back only changed boundaries. Zero code. **State that can live in the URL belongs there.**
- **Redraw** — input the browser holds and that should not be in a shareable URL. Annotate the component:

  ```html
  @reloadable
  export component OrderCard(id: string, orderID: int): html {
  <article class="card">
    <h3>Order {orderID}</h3>
  </article>
  }
  ```

  Requirements: exported, exactly one root element, a required `id` parameter, every other parameter a scalar a query string carries (records, slices, `html` are errors). A page-tree page needs no handler code; a registered handler can answer a redraw before its data load, below its auth check:

  ```go
  if !pw.Authenticated(r) { pw.WriteProblem(w, r, pw.Unauthorized()); return }
  if pw.Redraw(w, r, templates.OrdersPage) { return }   // page is named, not called
  ```

  A redraw's arguments come from the caller — a component loading a record by id must check ownership itself.
- **Action** — a mutation. Keep the mutation above the branch; clients without the runtime take the redirect:

  ```go
  if !pw.WantsUpdate(r) {
  	http.Redirect(w, r, "/orders", http.StatusSeeOther)
  	return
  }
  pw.WriteUpdate(w, r, http.StatusOK,
  	pw.Replace("order-summary", templates.Summary(templates.SummaryParams{Order: order})))
  ```

  A rejected submission returns 4xx and its regions are the validation errors. When the user belongs elsewhere: `pw.WriteUpdateNavigate(w, r, "/orders/17")`.

Links and GET forms are intercepted automatically, because the browser's fallback means the same thing as the enhanced request. **A POST form is not** — the runtime does not silently take ownership of an unsafe form, so the application opts in where it can also decide loading, error, and CSRF behaviour. The two ways in are `<form server-action>` (which opts in for you — see [interactivity.md](interactivity.md)) and a component script that submits with `updateHeaders()` and applies the response.

Browser API (feature-detect; updates may be disabled): `window.popcornweb.update({sort:"newest"})` (replaces the whole query — unnamed params are dropped), `.navigate("/orders/17")`, `.redraw("card-17", {orderID: 17})`, `.updateHeaders()` + `.apply(response)` around a `fetch` (`apply` accepts validation regions carried by a 4xx too). `data-tb-ignore` hands an element back to the browser; non-GET submissions, modified clicks, `target`, `download`, and cross-origin URLs always stay the browser's. `data-tb-preserve="name"` moves a region the server does not own (map, canvas, video) into the replacement. During an open update the root carries `data-tb-updating` — style it for a progress indicator.

Pitfalls: re-renders may be discarded, so rendering must be side-effect free (mutations belong in actions); a boundary embedding the clock ("3 seconds ago") never matches and is re-sent every time; a GET update cannot clear a form back to defaults — post-redirect-get clears through a page load.

**When not to use it:** a page that reloads in ~100 ms needs none of this. When the application wants to own the swapping (a dialog filled from a chosen route), use `pw.WriteHTMLFragment` instead. When the *server* learns something new without a request, use live rendering.

## Live rendering

A live source keeps producing, its boundary re-renders per value, and the browser holds one connection back to the page's own URL. Template syntax is unchanged — a live source binds in the same `await` clause as an async one, and switching a source `async` → `live` changes no calling template. The handler changes nothing: generated code calls the source with the subscription's context.

```html
external live WatchMetrics(id: string): Point
```

```go
func WatchMetrics(ctx context.Context, id string) iter.Seq2[Point, error] {
	return func(yield func(Point, error) bool) {
		ticker := time.NewTicker(time.Second)
		defer ticker.Stop()
		for {
			select {
			case <-ctx.Done():
				return
			case <-ticker.C:
				point, err := sample(ctx, id)
				if !yield(point, err) {
					return
				}
			}
		}
	}
}
```

Rules of the shape:

- The `context.Context` is **mandatory** — it is the only thing that ends an endless source.
- A yielded error is a delivery, not the end: the boundary shows `recover`, and the next good value restores primary content. The sequence returning is what ends the subscription.
- Pulling is the backpressure: one value at a time; a fast source blocks in `yield` and misses ticks.
- **A delivery is the whole region, not the change.** Yield the current list, not the new message; the source owns accumulation. A long list pays its length per delivery — keep the boundary around what actually changes.

The first response is an ordinary async stream: the first delivery completes the boundary and the document finishes, so crawlers and script-less browsers see one real render. A source producing nothing within `html.async_timeout` leaves the fallback — not a failure, nothing logged. Afterwards the runtime opens one connection (`GET` same URL with `Pw-Response-Mode: live`); the route executes again — same auth, same binding — writes no body, and streams one NDJSON record per delivery. Reconnects re-run the page; deploys and unknown boundary ids trigger one guarded reload.

A live region renders **output, not input**: `form`, `input`, `textarea`, `select`, or `contenteditable` in the primary subtree is a generation error. Put ARIA live-region attributes (`role="log"`) on an element **around** the boundary, not inside it.

A source may also yield a **signal** — a named instruction the page's own script
acts on, for the one event that must be seen rather than the state a region
shows. It is yielded where an error would be, renders nothing, and ends nothing:
`yield(Job{}, pw.NewSignal("app.finished", finished{URL: url}))`. See
[interactivity.md](interactivity.md).

Configuration under `[html]` (all require `streaming = true`): `live` (false is a safe dial — documents stay valid, no client connects), `live_max_duration` (default 10m; bounded lifetime with `live_duration_jitter` at 20%), `live_idle_timeout` (5m), `live_max_boundaries` (32), `live_max_responses` (4), `live_max_signal_bytes` (256 KiB of signal payload per response). Keep `middleware.request_timeout` above `live_max_duration` or at zero.

**When not to use it:** rendering is per client (ten screens = ten renders per tick) and each reconnect is a full page execution — count page executions per second, not connections. Share upstreams inside the source. For occasional freshness, a five-second poll or a plain reload is cheaper; for user-initiated changes, use partial updates.

## Forms

Baseline pattern — a plain POST with server-side rules, then post-redirect-get:

```html
<form method="post" action="/memos" class="mt-6 space-y-2">
  <textarea name="body" rows="3" required maxlength="200"></textarea>
  <button type="submit">Add</button>
</form>
```

```go
type createMemoInput struct {
	Body string `payload:"body" check:"required,maxlen=200"`
}

func createMemo(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	input, err := pw.Parse[createMemoInput](r)
	if err != nil {
		pw.WriteProblem(w, r, err)
		return
	}
	memos.add(input.Body)
	http.Redirect(w, r, "/", http.StatusSeeOther) // 303: reload re-reads, never resubmits
}
```

- The unsafe form's CSRF token is generated as its first hidden child — write nothing (see references/templates.md).
- HTML attributes (`required`, `maxlength`, `min`/`max`, `pattern`, input types) echo the `check` rules for immediate feedback; the server's `check` rules are the truth and must exist regardless. Never make an attribute narrower than its check.
- `pw.WriteProblem` answers a failed check as RFC 9457 problem JSON, or as the scaffolded `templates/400.pw.html` when `Accept` prefers HTML — no branch in the handler.

Re-rendering with the reader's text: `pw.Parse` returns the zero value on failure, so read the raw fields back:

```go
input, err := pw.Parse[createInput](r)
if err != nil {
	mapped, ok := httpbind.AsHTTPError(err)
	if !ok || len(mapped.Fields) == 0 {
		pw.WriteProblem(w, r, pw.BadRequest(err))
		return
	}
	form := FormState{Title: r.PostFormValue("title"), Owner: r.PostFormValue("owner")}
	applyFieldErrors(&form, mapped.Fields)
	pw.WriteHTML(w, r, NewTask(NewTaskParams{Form: form}))
	return
}
```

Style failures with `:user-invalid` (not `:invalid`, which matches untouched empty fields), and remember scoped selectors need a class to hang off.

Swap-library (htmx-style) path: answer with `pw.WriteHTMLFragment` — no shell, no merged head, never streams. A rejected form on this path answers **HTML with a 200**, because swap libraries do not swap non-2xx responses. Two routes (page + fragment) are usually clearer than one route branching on `HX-Request`. `examples/htmx_fragment` is the complete reference application.

Inside a page tree, `<form server-action="Retire">` replaces the hand-written
`action` with a Go handler name: generation writes the method, the handler
selector, and the CSRF token, and the same markup works with and without the
runtime. See [interactivity.md](interactivity.md).

**When not to use each:** plain PRG covers most forms — do not add a runtime for it. Reach for the partial-update action branch when a whole-page reload is what people notice; reach for fragments when the application owns the swap (a dialog that must stay open showing errors). Forms never belong inside a live boundary — that is a generation error.
