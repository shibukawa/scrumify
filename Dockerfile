# A Popcorn Web build is not "go build". The generated Go, the stylesheet, and
# the embedded asset tree under dist/ are build outputs that version control
# does not carry, so the builder stage runs "pw build" — generate, CSS, assets,
# then compile — rather than invoking the compiler itself. A Dockerfile that
# skipped that step would fail on undefined symbols whose sources are here.

# The Debian release is pinned alongside the Go version: a bare golang tag
# rebases onto each new stable Debian the day it releases, and the runtime
# stage below names its Debian release explicitly, so an unpinned builder
# would let the two drift apart on someone else's schedule.
